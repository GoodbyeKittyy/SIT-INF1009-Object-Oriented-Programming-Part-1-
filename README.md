## INF1009 Object Oriented Programming Part 1 Team Project

Thank you for stopping by! :)

This repository was completed in fulfilment for INF1009 Object Oriented Programming Part 1 Team Project (2024). This is a Java project utilizing libGDX library. <br><br>

## Project Deliverables:
Exhibit game engine implementation, showcasing the implementation of Simulation Lifecycle Management, Scene Management, Entity, Collisions, AI Control, Player Control and Input Control. <br><br>

## Build Instuctions:
There is no need for any additional software or modules besides Java installed on your system and an IDE that can import using the Github version control.
If you wish to manually import the files, you will need to include the libGDX library in your project dependencies or build a libGDX project and manually copy the files over.<br><br>

## How it works
1. Use the up, down, left, right keys to control the spaceship.
2. When you move the spaceship, it will print the new x, y position on the terminal.
3. The terminal will also print "Collision Detected!" when the spaceship and red ball collide. <br>
